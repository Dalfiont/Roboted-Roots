        <p>The inter-school debate was a success, and it had a positive impact on both the students who participated and the school 
            community as a whole. It was a great opportunity for students to learn about a controversial issue, to develop their critical 
            thinking skills, and to hone their public speaking skills. It was also a great opportunity for students to come together and 
            celebrate their school spirit.

              showed that the future is bright for STEM education.

            The school canteen sells food and drinks to students.And they provide a convenient way for students to eat or a drink during the school
             day.The canteen food portion can vary in size and offerings depending on the request of the student, but they typically offer a variety
              of food items, such as sandwiches, salads, fruits, snacks, and drinks. Sometimes the canteen also offer hot meals, such as pizza,
              pasta, or soup. They are now offering more nutritious food options, such as fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. The canteen is also
              now more affordable, so students can save money on their lunch or snack.

    <h4>Implemented Online Attendance Management System</h4>
    <img src="attendance.jpg" class="img-responsive col-lg-5 col-md-5 col-sm-5 col-xs-12">
    <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">1.Accuracy-Humans are inclined to errors even with computational devices. 
        Automated attendance systems however, are better at managing such as processing large amounts of data or performing repetitive tasks. 
        This is because machines are not susceptible to fatigue or boredom, and they can perform these tasks at a much faster rate than humans.

        2.Economics-Did you know that automated attendance systems can save costs? It can be programmed to be very efficient, which can help to 
        reduce waste of materials and energy. This can save money on their operational costs. A study has shown that large organisations save up 
        to 1600$ per employee after implamenting automated systems.

        3.Productivity/Efficiency-Automated attendance systems are better at productivity and efficiency than humans in a number of ways.They can 
        typically perform tasks much faster than humans. This is because they are not limited by factors such as fatigue, boredom, or the need to 
        take breaks.Thay are also much more consistent than humans at performing tasks. This means that they can produce the same output every 
        time, which is essential for many manufacturing and production processes.
